## Overview
Tangy, bright sour‑cream drizzle with fresh lime and a hint of garlic. Perfect for salmon tacos, roasted veg, bowls, and grilled meats.
- Serves: ~6–8 as a drizzle
- Gear: Small bowl, whisk, microplane/zester

## Ingredients (cook by feel)
- Sour cream, 1/2 cup
- 1 small garlic clove, very finely grated (or use a pinch of garlic powder)
- 1 lime: zest + 1–2 tbsp juice
- Pinch kosher salt
- Water to thin to a pourable consistency

## Steps
1. In a bowl, whisk sour cream, garlic, lime zest, and 1 tbsp lime juice with a pinch of salt.
2. Thin with cool water, a teaspoon at a time, to a smooth drizzle. Taste; add more lime or salt to balance.

## Notes / swaps
- Herb twist: stir in chopped dill, basil, or cilantro.
- Heat: add a dash of hot sauce or a pinch of cayenne to your portion only.
- Make‑ahead: keeps 3–4 days refrigerated; it thickens—re‑thin with water and re‑season before serving.
- Extra silky: replace 1–2 tbsp sour cream with mayo.
