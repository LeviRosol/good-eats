## Overview
Bright, nutty basil pesto with a jalapeño/serrano kick—one‑bowl, processor‑only method. Pipe neatly into jars and finish with an olive‑oil seal.
- Serves: ~4 cups total (4–6 small jars)
- Gear: Food processor, microplane/zester, zip‑top bag, sterilized jars with lids, spatula

## Ingredients (cook by feel)
- Fresh basil leaves, about 4 packed cups
- Pine nuts, 1 cup (lightly toasted in a little oil if you like)
- Garlic, ~12 cloves
- Lemon: zest of 1 + juice of 1
- Parmesan, finely grated, ~2 cups
- Kosher salt & black pepper
- Extra‑virgin olive oil, ~1 1/3 cups (plus more to seal jars)
- Garden peppers, ~8 small (mostly jalapeños + a couple serranos), stemmed; seed for mild

## Steps
1. Load the processor
   - Add basil, pine nuts, garlic, lemon zest and juice, Parmesan, a big pinch of salt, several grinds of pepper, peppers, and about 1 cup of the olive oil.

2. Blitz to texture
   - Run until smooth and spreadable, scraping the bowl as needed. Adjust thickness with more olive oil to reach a loose, glossy paste. Taste; balance salt, pepper, and lemon.

3. Pipe into jars
   - Transfer pesto to a zip‑top bag, press out air, and snip a corner. Pipe into sterilized jars, leaving ~1/2 inch headspace.

4. Seal with oil
   - Smooth the surface and float a thin layer of olive oil on top. Wipe rims and seal.

## Notes / swaps
- Heat control: seed peppers for mild; add them incrementally. Split the batch if you want a spicy jar for you and a mild jar for Jessica.
- Nuts: walnuts or almonds sub well; toast if desired for extra depth.
- Storage: refrigerate up to 1 week; freeze up to 3 months (ice‑cube trays work great). Top with fresh oil after thawing if needed.
- Use it: toss with hot pasta + pasta water, spread on grilled salmon or chicken, drizzle on roasted veg or crispy potatoes, swirl into your house sour‑cream drizzle.
