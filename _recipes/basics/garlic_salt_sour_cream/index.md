Yield: ~1 cup (scales easily) • Time: 5 minutes + chill

## Overview
A fast, addictive drizzle for roasted veggies, crispy potatoes, chops, tacos—pretty much everything. It’s just sour cream, garlic salt, and water to thin.

## Prep (do ahead 10–30 min)
- Mix first, then chill so the garlic blooms. Stir and re‑thin before serving.

## Ingredients (cook by feel)
- Sour cream (start ~½ cup)
- Garlic salt (generous—start ~¾ tsp per ½ cup; adjust)
- Cold water (1–3 tbsp) to reach drizzle consistency
- Optional: lemon juice (1–2 tsp) for brightness; pinch red pepper flakes; a little dill for fish/potatoes

## Method
1. In a small bowl, whisk sour cream with garlic salt until smooth.
2. Thin with cold water a little at a time until it drizzles off a spoon.
3. Chill 10–30 minutes. Stir; add a splash of water if it thickens.
4. Taste and adjust salt/garlic. Add optional lemon/heat/herbs if you like.

## Notes / use
- Keeps 3–4 days in the fridge; whisk before using.
- Great as a dip for medium‑rare steak bites (no judgment), spooned over smashed potatoes, or drizzled on roasted green beans.
