## Overview
Sweet, lightly charred pepper–onion strips—ideal taco side or topper; also great with grilled meats and bowls.
- Serves: 4–6
- Gear: Sheet pan, parchment (optional), large bowl

## Ingredients (cook by feel)
- Bell or sweet peppers, 3–4, seeded and sliced into 1/2‑in strips (mix colors; add a hot pepper if you like)
- 1 large onion, sliced into 1/2‑in strips
- Olive oil, 2–3 tbsp
- Kosher salt & black pepper
- 1 tsp each chili powder & paprika (or taco seasoning)
- 1/2 tsp ground cumin
- Optional: oregano or thyme; splash of lime; chopped basil/cilantro to finish

## Steps
1. Heat oven to 425°F (high convection if you have it). Line a sheet pan.
2. Toss peppers and onions with oil, salt/pepper, chili powder, paprika, and cumin.
3. Spread in a loose, even layer. Roast 15–20 min, tossing once, until edges char and veg are tender‑crisp.
4. Finish with a squeeze of lime and herbs if using. Taste and adjust salt.

## Notes / swaps
- Skillet option: hard sear in batches in cast iron over medium‑high for deeper char.
- Milder for Jessica: skip chili powder; finish with smoked paprika.
- Add‑ins: sliced mushrooms or zucchini roast well; add in last 10–12 min.
