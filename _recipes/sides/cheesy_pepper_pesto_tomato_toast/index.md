## Overview
Buttery toasted French bread topped with pepper‑pesto, thick tomato slices, and melted Havarti—quick, rich, and ridiculously good.
- Serves: 2–4 (snack/side)
- Gear: Small sheet pan lined with foil, knife, broiler

## Ingredients (cook by feel)
- Small loaf French bread (split lengthwise)
- Butter, softened
- Kosher salt & black pepper
- Pepper Pesto (generous layer)
- 1 ripe tomato, thick‑sliced
- Havarti cheese, sliced

## Steps
1. Toast the bread
   - Heat oven to 450°F. Split bread, butter generously, season with a little salt/pepper. Bake cut‑side up until lightly browned.

2. Load it up
   - Spread a solid layer of pepper pesto. Shingle thick tomato slices, then Havarti.

3. Broil
   - Switch to broil. Return to oven and broil until cheese is melted and just browned at the edges.

4. Finish & serve
   - Crack fresh pepper over the top, slice into strips, and serve hot.

## Notes / swaps
- Cheese swaps: provolone, mozzarella, or fontina.
- Add‑ons: prosciutto or crispy bacon; drizzle of balsamic after broil.
- Herb hit: extra basil on top right before serving.
