## Overview
Charred, tender‑crisp green beans tossed in chili‑lime butter, creamy cotija-style topping, and herby finish—a street‑corn vibe without the corn.
- Serves: 4
- Gear: 12‑in cast iron or large skillet, tongs, microplane/zester, small bowl

## Ingredients (cook by feel)
### Beans
- Green beans, ~1 lb, trimmed and patted dry
- Neutral oil, 1–2 tbsp
- Kosher salt & black pepper

### Chili‑lime butter
- Butter, 2 tbsp (melted)
- 1 tsp chili powder
- 1/2 tsp paprika (sweet or smoked)
- 1/2 tsp ground cumin
- Zest of 1 lime + 1–2 tbsp lime juice
- Pinch sugar or honey (optional, to balance)

### Creamy/cheesy finish
- 2–3 tbsp sour cream or mayo (or a mix)
- 1–2 oz cotija or Parmesan, finely crumbled/grated (plus extra to sprinkle)

### Herbs & extras
- Chopped cilantro and/or basil
- Optional: minced jalapeño or a few dashes hot sauce (your portion only)

## Steps
1. Mix the finish
   - In a small bowl, combine sour cream/mayo with half the cheese and a squeeze of lime; thin with a spoon of water to dollop/drizzle. Set aside.

2. Char the beans
   - Heat cast iron over medium‑high until hot. Add a thin film of oil.
   - Add beans in a single layer; season with salt/pepper. Sear undisturbed 2–3 min to blister, then toss and cook 4–6 min more until crisp‑tender with charred spots.

3. Season
   - Cut heat to medium‑low. Stir in melted butter, chili powder, paprika, cumin, and lime zest; toss to coat 30–60 sec. Splash in lime juice to brighten.

4. Finish & serve
   - Transfer to a platter. Dollop/drizzle the creamy mix, shower with remaining cheese and herbs. Add jalapeño or hot sauce to yours only. Serve immediately.

## Notes / swaps
- Grill option: toss beans with oil/salt; grill in a basket over high heat, then finish with chili‑lime butter off the grill.
- Dairy‑free: use vegan mayo and skip cheese; add toasted pepitas for crunch.
- Make it “esquites”: add a small handful of corn kernels in the last 2–3 min of the sauté.
