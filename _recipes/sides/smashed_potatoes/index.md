Serves: 2–4 (as a side)

## Overview
Small potatoes boiled to just‑tender, smashed on a hot oiled sheet, then roasted until shattery‑crisp. Finish with salt, pepper, and your favorite drizzle (garlic‑salt sour‑cream is a banger).

## Prep (do ahead 10–20 min)
- Rinse potatoes; sort similar sizes.
- Preheat oven to 425–450°F (218–232°C) with a sheet pan inside.
- If using the garlic‑salt sour‑cream drizzle, mix it now and chill.

## Ingredients (cook by feel)
- 1½–2 lb small white or Yukon potatoes
- Olive oil
- Kosher salt & black pepper
- Garlic powder or minced garlic (optional)
- Herbs: rosemary and/or thyme (optional)
- Optional heat: red pepper flakes (do half the pan if needed)

## Steps
1. Parboil
   - Potatoes into well‑salted cold water; bring to a boil and cook until a knife slides in with slight resistance (8–12 min depending on size).
   - Drain and steam‑dry 1–2 min.

2. Smash
   - Oil the hot sheet pan lightly.
   - Place potatoes and smash gently with a sturdy glass/cup to ~½–¾ in thick—keep them mostly intact.

3. Season
   - Drizzle or brush with olive oil.
   - Season generously with salt & pepper; add garlic and herbs.
   - Optional: red pepper flakes on your half.

4. Roast
   - 425–450°F: roast ~20 min.
   - Flip (or just rotate) and roast another 10–15 min until deeply browned and crisp at the edges.
   - For extra crunch, broil 1–2 min at the end—watch closely.

5. Serve
   - Taste for salt. Finish with a light drizzle of olive oil or the garlic‑salt sour‑cream sauce. Great with lemon zest, Parm, or chopped herbs.

## Notes / tweaks
- Extra shatter: toss parboiled potatoes with ½ tsp baking soda per 1½ lb before smashing (alkaline roughens the surface).
- Make‑ahead: parboil earlier in the day; smash/roast just before serving.
- Variations: smoked paprika + garlic; ranch spice; Parm + black pepper.
