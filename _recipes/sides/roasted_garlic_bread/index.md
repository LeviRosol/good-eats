## Overview
Sweet, mellow roasted‑garlic butter slathered on French bread and broiled to gold. Add a shower of toasted panko for crunch.
- Serves: 4–6
- Gear: Sheet pan, foil, small bowl, broiler

## Ingredients (cook by feel)
- Small French bread loaf, split lengthwise
- Garlic heads, 1–2
- Olive oil
- Butter, softened, 4–6 tbsp
- Kosher salt & black pepper
- Parsley or basil, chopped (optional)
- Parmesan, grated (optional)

### Crunch option
- Panko, ~1/2 cup
- Olive oil or butter, 1–2 tbsp
- Pinch salt
- Optional: a squeeze of roasted garlic

## Steps
1. Roast the garlic
   - Heat oven to 400°F. Slice tops off garlic heads to expose cloves; drizzle with olive oil and a pinch of salt. Wrap in foil; roast 35–45 min until soft and caramelized. Cool slightly; squeeze out cloves.

2. Make garlic butter
   - Mash roasted garlic with softened butter, a pinch of salt/pepper, and herbs/Parm if using.

3. Toast panko (optional crunch)
   - In a small skillet, toast panko in oil/butter with a pinch of salt until golden.

4. Toast and broil
   - Switch oven to broil. Lightly toast bread cut‑side up a minute or two. Spread roasted‑garlic butter generously; broil to bubbly and golden at edges.

5. Finish
   - Sprinkle toasted panko (and Parm) over the top. Slice and serve hot.

## Notes / swaps
- Faster garlic: wrap separated cloves (skin on) and roast 20–25 min.
- Herb twist: add basil/dill; finish with a tiny squeeze of lemon.
