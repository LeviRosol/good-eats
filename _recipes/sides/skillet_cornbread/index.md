## Overview
Golden, crisp‑edged cornbread baked in screaming‑hot cast iron. Uses a boxed mix, boosted with butter and a touch of honey.
- Serves: 8 wedges
- Gear: 10–12‑in cast‑iron skillet, mixing bowl, spatula

## Ingredients (cook by feel)
- Boxed cornbread mix (8.5–15 oz box, e.g., Jiffy or similar) — use 1 large box or 2 small for a 12‑in skillet
- Eggs and milk per box directions
- Butter, 3–4 tbsp (2 tbsp for the pan, 1–2 tbsp melted into batter)
- Honey, 1–2 tbsp (optional, for a lightly sweet glaze)
- Pinch kosher salt (if mix is very sweet)

## Steps
1. Heat the skillet
   - Set oven to 400–425°F. Place cast iron inside with 2 tbsp butter to preheat and sizzle.

2. Mix batter
   - In a bowl, whisk eggs and milk per box. Stir in mix just to combine. Fold in 1–2 tbsp melted butter and a pinch of salt if desired. Do not overmix.

3. Pan, pour, bake
   - Carefully remove hot skillet; swirl to coat with melted butter (add a touch more if dry).
   - Pour in batter; it should sizzle at the edges. Bake 12–18 min (depending on skillet size/mix) until golden and a toothpick comes out clean.

4. Finish
   - Brush top with a little honey (and/or butter). Rest 5 min; slice into wedges.

## Notes / upgrades
- Add‑ins: 1/2 cup corn kernels, diced jalapeño (your side only), or shredded cheddar.
- Extra crisp: after baking, broil 1–2 min to deepen color.
- Serve with: salted butter, hot honey, or your canned salsa alongside the gumbo.
