## Overview
Mississippi roast with a cast‑iron sear and red‑wine deglaze for extra depth. Slow‑cook with hot banana peppers and baby potatoes, shred, reduce the pot juices into a peppery au jus, and broil cheese‑topped French dips.
- Serves: 6–8 sandwiches
- Gear: Slow cooker (6–8 qt), 12‑in cast iron, sheet pan, strainer, small saucepan, tongs

## Ingredients (cook by feel)
### Roast
- Beef chuck/arm roast, 3–4 lb
- Extra‑virgin olive oil (to rub)
- Kosher salt & heavy black pepper
- Ranch seasoning packet (1)
- Au jus gravy packet (1)
- Hot banana peppers, 1 jar, sliced + 1/3–1/2 cup brine
- Unsalted butter, 4–6 tbsp (cut up)
- Small potatoes, 1.5–2 lb, halved
- Onion, 1 (optional), thick slices
- Garlic, 3–4 cloves, smashed (optional)
- Dry red wine, 1/2–3/4 cup (for deglaze)

### Sandwiches
- French “everything” sandwich rolls
- Provolone or Havarti slices
- Optional toppers: giardiniera, extra peppers, pepper pesto drizzle (your portion)

## Steps
1. Sear the roast
   - Pat roast dry; rub lightly with EVOO. Season generously with salt and heavy pepper.
   - Heat cast iron over medium‑high to a light smoke; sear roast 2–3 min per side to deep brown. Transfer roast to slow cooker on top of onions/garlic (if using). Scatter potatoes around.

2. Deglaze
   - Pour red wine into hot skillet; scrape up fond. Reduce 1–2 min and pour into the slow cooker.

3. Load flavors
   - Sprinkle ranch and au jus packets over roast. Add sliced banana peppers and 1/3–1/2 cup brine. Dot butter on top. Add a few grinds of pepper.

4. Cook
   - Low 8–10 hours (preferred) or High 5–6 hours, until roast shreds easily and potatoes are tender.

5. Shred and strain
   - Move roast to a board; shred into chunky strands. Scoop potatoes to a platter.
   - Strain cooker liquid into a saucepan; skim fat. Simmer 5–10 min to reduce into a flavorful au jus. Taste; balance with a splash of pepper brine or water as needed.

6. Toast rolls and melt cheese
   - Heat broiler. Split rolls; brush cut sides with a little butter/oil; broil to lightly toast.
   - Pile shredded beef on bottoms; top with cheese. Broil just until melted and browned at edges.

7. Serve
   - Add potatoes alongside. Top sandwiches with peppers/giardiniera if desired. Serve with warm au jus for dipping.

## Notes / swaps
- Salt caution: packets and brine are salty—adjust added salt to taste.
- Mild for Jessica: use fewer hot peppers or rinse some; keep extra heat for your sandwich.
- Make‑ahead: reheat beef in a little au jus; re‑crisp rolls under broiler.
