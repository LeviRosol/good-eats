## Overview
Set‑and‑forget Mississippi roast with hot banana peppers and baby potatoes. Shred the beef, strain the pot juices into a peppery au jus, and broil cheese‑topped French rolls for dunking.
- Serves: 6–8 sandwiches
- Gear: Slow cooker (6–8 qt), sheet pan, strainer, small saucepan (for au jus), tongs

## Ingredients (cook by feel)
### Roast
- Beef chuck/arm roast, 3–4 lb
- Ranch seasoning packet (1)
- Au jus gravy packet (1)
- Hot banana peppers, 1 jar, sliced + 1/3–1/2 cup brine
- Unsalted butter, 4–6 tbsp (cut up)
- Small potatoes, 1.5–2 lb, halved
- Onion, 1 (optional), thick slices
- Garlic, 3–4 cloves, smashed (optional)
- Black pepper; kosher salt only if needed (packets are salty)

### Sandwiches
- French “everything” sandwich rolls
- Provolone or Havarti slices
- Optional toppers: giardiniera, pepper pesto drizzle (your portion), extra peppers

## Steps
1. Load the slow cooker
   - Layer onions/garlic (if using), then the roast (pat dry). Scatter potatoes around.
   - Sprinkle ranch and au jus packets over roast. Add sliced banana peppers and 1/3–1/2 cup brine. Dot butter on top. Black pepper to taste.

2. Cook
   - Low 8–10 hours (preferred) or High 5–6 hours, until roast shreds easily and potatoes are tender.

3. Shred and strain
   - Transfer roast to a board; shred into chunky strands. Scoop out potatoes to a platter.
   - Pour cooker liquid through a strainer into a saucepan; skim fat. Simmer 5–10 min to reduce to a flavorful au jus. Taste; add pepper brine or water to balance.

4. Toast rolls and melt cheese
   - Heat broiler. Split rolls, brush cut sides with a little butter or oil. Broil cut‑side up until lightly golden.
   - Pile shredded beef on bottoms, lay cheese on top. Broil briefly until cheese melts and browns at the edges.

5. Serve
   - Add potatoes alongside. Spoon peppers/giardiniera over sandwiches if desired. Serve with warm au jus for dipping.

## Notes / swaps
- Mild option for Jessica: use fewer hot peppers or rinse some; keep extra heat for your sandwich.
- If very salty: dilute au jus with a splash of water/low‑sodium stock; finish with a knob of butter.
- Make‑ahead: roast holds well; reheat meat in some au jus. Potatoes rewarm in microwave or skillet with a little butter.
