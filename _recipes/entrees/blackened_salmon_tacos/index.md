## Overview
Crispy‑edged, spice‑rubbed salmon flaked into warm, flame‑kissed tortillas. Bright, tangy lime‑garlic sour cream ties it together. Add cucumber‑tomato pico or your canned salsa at the table.
- Serves: 4 (8–10 tacos)
- Gear: 12‑in cast iron, fish spatula, small bowl, zester, tongs, metal taco racks (for serving)

## Prep (10–15 min)
- Stir together Lime‑Garlic Sour Cream (below); chill.
- Slice limes into wedges.
- Optional pico: small‑dice cucumbers and tomatoes; toss with lime, salt, and basil/cilantro.
- Pat salmon dry; pull any pin bones; portion into 3–4 logs for easier searing.

## Ingredients (cook by feel)
### Salmon + rub
- 2 lb salmon fillet, skin on if possible
- Neutral oil (high‑heat)
- Kosher salt & black pepper
- Rub (mix): 1 tsp each chili powder & paprika; 1/2–1 tsp cumin; 1/2 tsp garlic powder; pinch oregano; optional pinch brown sugar; red pepper flakes on your half only

### Tortillas
- 8–12 small flour or corn tortillas

### Lime‑Garlic Sour Cream
- 1/2 cup sour cream
- 1 clove garlic, very finely grated (or use your house drizzle base)
- Zest of 1 lime + 1–2 tbsp lime juice
- Pinch kosher salt; thin with water to drizzle

### Toppings (choose)
- Cucumber‑tomato pico or your canned salsa
- Shredded cabbage or lettuce (optional)
- Fresh basil and/or cilantro, chopped
- Radish slices (optional)
- Lime wedges

## Steps
1. Make the sauce
   - In a small bowl, combine sour cream, garlic, lime zest/juice, pinch of salt; whisk. Thin with water to a smooth drizzle. Chill.

2. Season the salmon
   - Mix rub. Pat salmon very dry. Lightly oil; season with salt/pepper. Dust rub evenly (go lighter on Jessica’s portion).

3. Sear
   - Heat cast iron over medium‑high to a light smoke; film with oil.
   - Place salmon flesh‑side down 2–3 min to crust. Flip to skin‑side; lower to medium and cook to medium/medium‑rare (about 120–125°F) or your preference, 3–6 min depending on thickness.
   - Optional: baste with a knob of butter the last 30 sec. Rest 2–3 min; flake into large chunks and discard skin if not crisp.

4. Char tortillas
   - Using tongs over a gas flame (or dry skillet), kiss each tortilla 10–20 sec per side until pliable and lightly charred. Wrap in a towel to keep warm.

5. Build & serve
   - Load taco racks with tortillas. Add salmon, drizzle with lime‑garlic sour cream, then toppings. Serve with lime wedges and salsa on the side.

## Notes / swaps
- Spice: sub blackening seasoning if you have it; add smoked paprika for depth.
- Herb twist: basil + dill are great with salmon.
- Make‑ahead: sauce holds 2–3 days; thin again before serving.
- Leftovers: great as a salmon taco bowl over rice with roasted peppers/onions.
