## Overview
Boil-then-crisp ravioli, juicy seared chicken, and a quick pepper‑pesto cream made silky with a splash of pasta water. Golden edges, big basil‑pepper flavor, fast cleanup.
- Serves: 3–4
- Gear: 12‑in skillet, pot for pasta, tongs, wooden spoon

## Ingredients (cook by feel)
- Frozen ravioli, 18–24 oz (cheese or meat)
- Chicken: 1 lb boneless thighs or breasts, bite‑size strips
- Olive oil + butter
- Kosher salt & black pepper
- Pepper Pesto, 1/3–1/2 cup (to taste)
- Sour cream or heavy cream, 2–4 tbsp (optional for extra silk)
- Parmesan, finely grated
- Pasta water (reserve a mug)
- Lemon (squeeze to finish)
- Fresh basil (optional), chopped

## Steps
1. Boil ravioli
   - Salt a pot of water; boil ravioli just shy of package time. Reserve a mug of pasta water; drain well.

2. Sear chicken
   - While ravioli boils, heat skillet over medium‑high with a film of oil. Season chicken with salt/pepper; sear until browned and just cooked through. Transfer to a warm plate.

3. Crisp ravioli
   - Return skillet to medium‑high; add 1–2 tbsp butter + a drizzle of oil. Add drained ravioli in a single layer; cook 2–3 min per side until golden and crisp at the edges (work in batches if needed).

4. Make the sauce
   - Lower heat to medium‑low. Add chicken back. Stir in 1/3–1/2 cup pepper pesto and a small splash of pasta water to loosen. Optional: add 2–4 tbsp sour cream or a glug of cream. Toss gently to coat; add splashes of pasta water until glossy.

5. Finish & serve
   - Season to taste; add a small squeeze of lemon. Plate with Parmesan and basil.

## Notes / swaps
- Keep it mild for Jessica by seeding hot peppers in the pesto batch; add chili flakes at the table for yours.
- No dairy finish: skip sour cream; use extra pasta water + butter for emulsion.
- Extra veg: wilt in a handful of spinach or peas at the end.
