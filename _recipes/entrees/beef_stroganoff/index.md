Serves: 4–6
Gear: 12‑in skillet or sauté pan, 4‑qt pot for pasta, wooden spoon

## Overview
A grown‑up nod to the childhood creamy beef elbows, leaning classic stroganoff: browned beef, onions, mushrooms, Dijon, Worcestershire, and a silky sour‑cream finish. No canned soup—fast, rich, and weeknight‑friendly.

## Prep (10–15 min)
- Dice 1 onion; mince 2–3 garlic cloves.
- Slice 8–12 oz mushrooms (cremini or button).
- Start a pot of salted water for elbows.

## Ingredients (cook by feel)
### Pasta
- 12–16 oz elbow macaroni (cook separately)

### Beef & aromatics
- 1 lb ground beef (80/20 ideal)
- Olive oil or butter, 1–2 tbsp
- 1 onion, diced
- 2–3 garlic cloves, minced
- 8–12 oz mushrooms, sliced
- Kosher salt & black pepper

### Sauce base
- 2 tbsp butter
- 1–2 tbsp flour (light thickener)
- 1 cup beef stock (plus more as needed)
- 1 tbsp Dijon mustard
- 1–2 tsp Worcestershire
- 1/2 tsp paprika (optional)
- 1/4 cup dry white wine or brandy (optional, for deglaze)

### Creamy finish
- 1/2 cup sour cream (more to taste)
- 2–3 tbsp chopped fresh parsley (or dill)
- Lemon juice, small squeeze, to brighten

### Optional “Italian‑ish” echo
- Pinch Italian seasoning or thyme
- Parmesan, finely grated, for serving

## Steps
1. Boil pasta
   - Cook elbows in well‑salted water to al dente. Drain; toss with a little olive oil. Keep separate.

2. Brown beef
   - Heat skillet over medium‑high with a thin film of oil/butter. Brown beef hard; season with salt/pepper. Scoop to a warm plate, leaving fond.

3. Sauté veg
   - Add a touch of butter if dry. Cook onions with a pinch of salt 3–4 min. Add mushrooms; cook until browned and moisture cooks off, 5–7 min. Stir in garlic 30–60 sec.

4. Build the pan sauce
   - Deglaze with wine/brandy (if using); reduce by half.
   - Add 2 tbsp butter; sprinkle flour; stir 30–60 sec.
   - Whisk in stock gradually to a light gravy. Stir in Dijon, Worcestershire, and paprika (plus a tiny pinch Italian seasoning if you want that nostalgia). Simmer 2–3 min to thicken slightly.

5. Make it stroganoff‑creamy
   - Return beef and any juices. Lower heat to medium‑low. Off heat, stir in sour cream until silky (don’t boil). Adjust thickness with a splash of stock; season with salt/pepper and a small squeeze of lemon.

6. Serve
   - Spoon sauce over bowls of elbows, or fold pasta into the skillet if serving all at once.
   - Finish with parsley (or dill) and optional Parmesan. Red pepper flakes on your bowl only to keep Jessica’s mild.

## Notes / swaps
- Meat: half beef + half pork (or Italian sausage) is great; ground turkey works—use extra butter.
- Broth: chicken stock is fine; add a dash of soy sauce for depth if your stock is light.
- Add‑ins: peas or spinach fold in at the end; for extra umami, add 1 tsp Dijon + 1 tsp fish sauce or miso.
- Make‑ahead: keep pasta separate; loosen leftovers with stock and a spoon of sour cream when reheating.
