## Overview
Hearty, tomato‑forward goulash with Italian sausage and venison, mellow onions and garlic, and a spicy kick from hot pepper mix/giardiniera. Simmered until saucy, then served over tender elbow macaroni (cooked separately so you control doneness). Easy to split the heat for Jessica.

- Serves: 6–8
- Gear: 6–8 qt Dutch oven or stockpot, large skillet (optional), wooden spoon

## Prep (10–15 min)
- Dice 2 onions; mince 1 head of garlic.
- If using very spicy hot pepper mix, set some aside to add at the end to taste.
- Start a pot of salted water for pasta (you’ll cook it separately).

## Ingredients (cook by feel)
### Base
- Olive oil, ~2 tbsp
- 2 onions, diced
- 1 head garlic, minced

### Meat
- 2 lb Italian sausage (mild or hot)
- 1 lb ground venison (or beef)

### Seasoning
- 2 tbsp Italian seasoning
- 4 bay leaves
- 1 tbsp chili powder
- 2 tbsp paprika (sweet; sub half smoked if you like)

### Tomato & liquid
- 32 oz marinara
- 32 oz chicken stock
- 2 cans diced tomatoes (14–15 oz each), with juices
- 1 can tomato paste (6 oz)
- 1 cup white wine

### Heat & extras
- ~1 cup hot pepper mix/giardiniera (add to taste; can split)
- Kosher salt & black pepper

### To serve
- 2 lb elbow macaroni (cook separately in salted water)
- Big handful fresh basil (optional), chopped
- Parmesan, grated (optional)

## Steps
1. Sauté aromatics
   - Film pot with olive oil over medium. Cook onions with a pinch of salt until translucent, 5–7 min. Add garlic; stir 30–60 sec.
2. Brown the meat
   - Add sausage and venison. Break up and brown until no pink, 6–8 min. Spoon off excess fat if needed.
   - Stir in Italian seasoning, chili powder, paprika, and bay leaves; toast 30 sec.
3. Build the sauce
   - Deglaze with white wine; scrape fond; reduce by about half.
   - Add marinara, diced tomatoes, and tomato paste. Stir to combine. Season with salt and pepper.
4. Heat control
   - Stir in hot pepper mix to taste. For low‑spice: add to your bowls later, or split the pot and spice one side.
   - Simmer covered 30–60 min over low, stirring occasionally. Uncover last 10–15 min to thicken to a hearty, spoon‑coating consistency. Balance with a splash of water or stock if too tight.
5. Pasta
   - Boil elbows in well‑salted water until just shy of al dente. Drain, toss with a little olive oil.
   - Serve pasta in bowls and ladle goulash over, or fold in pasta right before serving if eating all at once.
6. Finish & serve
   - Fish out bay leaves. Adjust salt/pepper. Optional: fresh basil and Parmesan.
   - For creaminess/contrast, add a drizzle of garlic‑salt sour‑cream on top.

## Notes / swaps
- Protein: all beef works; turkey + pork also good. If venison is very lean, add a knob of butter while browning.
- Liquids: sub stock for wine. A splash of balsamic or lemon brightens at the end.
- Veg boosters: diced bell pepper or mushrooms can sauté with the onions.
- Make‑ahead: improves on day 2. Keep pasta separate to avoid swelling; reheat with a splash of water.
- Heat: giardiniera varies—start with 1/4–1/2 cup, add more at the end. Red pepper flakes on your bowl keeps Jessica’s mild.
