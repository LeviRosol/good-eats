## Overview
Classic diner vibes: cinnamon‑vanilla French toast as the “bun,” locker sausage patty, fried egg, and a melty slice of Velveeta. Served with maple syrup for dipping and a cold glass of milk.
- Serves: 2–4 (2 if hungry)
- Gear: 12‑in skillet or griddle, mixing bowl, whisk, spatula

## Ingredients (cook by feel)
### French toast
- Thick bread slices (Texas toast or similar), 4–8
- Eggs, 2
- Milk, 1/2 cup (plus more as needed)
- Vanilla, 1 tsp
- Cinnamon, 1/2 tsp
- Pinch salt
- Butter for the pan

### Sandwich fixings
- Breakfast sausage patties (locker sourced), 2–4
- Eggs, 2–4
- Velveeta slices, 2–4
- Maple syrup (for dipping)
- Black pepper

## Steps
1. Make the custard
   - Whisk eggs, milk, vanilla, cinnamon, and a pinch of salt until smooth. Soak bread briefly on both sides.

2. Cook sausage
   - In a skillet over medium heat, cook sausage patties until browned and cooked through; keep warm.

3. Fry the French toast
   - Butter the skillet/griddle. Cook soaked bread over medium heat until golden on both sides; hold warm.

4. Fry eggs
   - Add a little butter. Fry eggs to preference (runny or set). Season with pepper.

5. Build sandwiches
   - Stack one French toast slice, a sausage patty, a slice of Velveeta, and a fried egg; cap with another slice of French toast.

6. Serve
   - Dip in warm maple syrup. Glass of milk on the side.

## Notes / swaps
- Extra rich: dust toast with powdered sugar before building.
- Savory tilt: skip vanilla/cinnamon; add black pepper to custard and serve with hot sauce.
- Add-ons: a few pickle chips or a swipe of mustard for a McGriddle‑adjacent twist.
