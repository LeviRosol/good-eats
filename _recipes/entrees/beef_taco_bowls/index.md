## Overview
Carne guisada–style braised beef over rice or crispy potatoes, simmered with fresh tomatoes, onions, and garden peppers. Built for split heat—keep Jessica’s mild and spike yours.
- Serves: 4
- Gear: 12‑in cast iron or Dutch oven, saucepan or sheet pan (for rice/potatoes)

## Ingredients (cook by feel)
### Beef & base
- Stew beef, 1.5–2 lb, cut bite‑size
- Olive/neutral oil
- Kosher salt & black pepper
- Onion, 1 large, diced
- Garlic, 4–5 cloves, minced
- Tomatoes, 2–3 (or a can diced)
- Garden peppers: banana + jalapeño (seed for mild); serrano for extra heat (your portion)
- Tomato paste, 1 tbsp (optional)

### Spices & liquid
- Chili powder, 1–2 tsp
- Ground cumin, 1–2 tsp
- Dried oregano, 1 tsp
- Paprika, 1 tsp (sweet or smoked)
- Bay leaf (optional)
- Beef stock or water, 1–2 cups
- Lime or cider vinegar, to finish

### Bowl bases and toppings
- Cooked rice OR crispy smashed small potatoes
- Lime‑garlic sour cream or house drizzle
- Fresh herbs: cilantro and/or basil
- Cheese (optional), avocado (optional), extra tomatoes/peppers, hot sauce (yours)

## Steps
1. Brown the beef
   - Heat pot with a film of oil until shimmering. Pat beef dry; salt/pepper. Brown hard in batches; remove.

2. Build the base
   - Add onion with a pinch of salt 3–4 min. Add chopped peppers 2–3 min. Stir in garlic 30 sec.
   - Add chili powder, cumin, oregano, paprika; toast 30 sec. Stir in tomato paste (if using) 30 sec.

3. Sauce and simmer
   - Deglaze with ~1/2 cup stock/water; scrape fond. Add chopped tomatoes and 1/2–1 cup more stock.
   - Return beef + juices; add bay leaf. Simmer covered on low 30–45 min until spoon‑tender, adding splashes of liquid as needed.

4. Finish
   - Fish out bay. Season to taste. Brighten with a squeeze of lime or a splash of vinegar.

5. Build bowls
   - Base: rice or crispy potatoes. Top with beef and its sauce.
   - Finish with drizzle, herbs, lime wedges, and optional cheese/avocado. Keep Jessica’s mild; add sliced serrano or hot sauce to yours.

## Notes / swaps
- Faster cook: pressure cook 25–30 min on high, natural release 10 min; reduce sauce on sauté.
- Veg add‑ins: corn or black beans in last 5–10 min. Spinach wilts in at the end.
- Make‑ahead: improves next day; reheat with a splash of water/stock.
