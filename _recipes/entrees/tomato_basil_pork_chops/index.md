## Overview
Thick‑seared pork chops finished in a silky tomato–basil pan sauce. Sour cream brings the creaminess (no heavy cream), cherry tomatoes add fresh pop.
- Serves: 2
- Gear: 12‑in cast iron, instant‑read thermometer

## Prep (do ahead 10–20 min)
- Mix a small bowl of minced shallot and garlic.
- Halve a handful of cherry tomatoes.
- Chiffonade a big handful of basil.
- Pat chops dry; season all over with kosher salt and black pepper. Let sit at room temp ~15 min.

## Ingredients (cook by feel)
### Pork
- 2 thick chops (1–1¼ in)
- Kosher salt & black pepper
- Neutral oil + butter (for searing/basting)
- Herbs: rosemary + oregano (or thyme if you have it)
- 4–6 garlic cloves, lightly smashed (for basting)

### Pan sauce
- 1 small shallot (or ¼ onion), minced
- 1–2 garlic cloves, minced
- Cherry tomatoes, halved (good handful)
- White wine (splash ~⅓ cup) or chicken stock (~½ cup)
- Marinara (~½–¾ cup)
- Sour cream (2–3 heaping tbsp; fold in off heat)
- Butter (small knob)
- Big handful basil, sliced
- Optional: 1–2 tsp balsamic or a squeeze of lemon; pinch red pepper flakes
- Parmesan, finely grated (to finish)

## Steps
1. Sear the chops
   - Heat cast iron over medium‑high 3–4 min to a light smoke; add a thin film of oil.
   - Sear chops 2–3 min per side to deep golden. Add 1–2 tbsp butter, smashed garlic, and rosemary/oregano; baste 30–60 sec.
   - Lower to medium; cook, flipping, to 135–140°F internal. Transfer to a warm plate to rest 5–8 min (carryover to 145°F).

2. Build the sauce
   - Pour off excess fat, leave ~1 tbsp.
   - Sauté minced shallot + garlic 30–60 sec.
   - Add cherry tomatoes + pinch salt; blister 2–3 min, mash a few for body.
   - Deglaze with wine/stock; scrape fond; reduce by about half.
   - Stir in marinara; simmer 1–2 min.
   - Off heat, whisk in sour cream until silky (don’t boil).
   - Finish with a knob of butter and basil; balance with balsamic/lemon; season to taste.

3. Optional oven melt (nice touch)
   - Nestle chops back into sauce, shower with Parm + basil; slide skillet into a hot oven 2–4 min to melt/bubble. Rest 2–3 min.

4. Serve
   - Spoon sauce over chops; finish with fresh basil and Parm.

## Notes / swaps
- Herbs: rosemary + oregano + basil play great; thyme if available.
- Brightness: a teaspoon of balsamic or squeeze of lemon makes flavors pop.
- If the sauce hints at splitting, whisk in a teaspoon of cold water and a small knob of butter.
