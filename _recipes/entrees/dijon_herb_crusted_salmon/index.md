Serves: 2–4 • Oven: 425°F (218°C) • Gear: sheet pan (or cast‑iron), instant‑read thermometer

## Overview
Two fast, high‑reward ways to cook salmon that play perfectly with roasted green beans and crispy/smashed potatoes. Target a juicy 125–130°F center.

## Prep (10 minutes)
- Pat salmon dry. Pin‑bone if needed.
- Season both sides lightly with kosher salt & black pepper.
- Trim green beans (if using) and start potatoes as needed.
- Preheat oven to 425°F with pan inside (for sheet‑pan method).

## Option 1 — Brown‑Butter Lemon (pan‑sear, finish if thick)
### You’ll need
- 2 tbsp butter, lemon wedges, chopped basil (or parsley)
- Neutral oil

### Steps
1. Heat a film of oil in a skillet over medium‑high until shimmering.
2. Add salmon skin‑side down; press gently 10–15 sec to prevent curl.
3. Sear 3–4 min without moving until most flesh has lightened; flip 1–2 min.
4. Add butter; when foamy and nutty, kill heat. Spoon brown butter over fish 20–30 sec.
5. If fillets are thick, slide pan into the 425°F oven 2–4 min to 125–130°F.
6. Finish with lemon juice and chopped basil. Season to taste.

## Option 2 — Dijon‑Herb Crust (one‑sheet)
### You’ll need
- 2 tbsp Dijon + 1 tbsp olive oil + 1 tsp honey
- 1 small garlic clove, minced
- 1–2 tbsp chopped herbs (rosemary/oregano/basil)
- Optional: ¼–⅓ cup fine breadcrumbs or crushed Ritz + 2 tbsp Parm

### Steps
1. Whisk Dijon, oil, honey, garlic, herbs (pinch chili optional).
2. Place salmon on hot sheet pan (parchment optional). Spread the Dijon mix.
3. Top with crumbs/Parm if using; press lightly.
4. Roast 8–12 min at 425°F to 125–130°F; broil 30–60 sec to brown if needed.
5. Rest 2–3 min; finish with lemon.

## Timing with sides (single sheet)
- Start potatoes first (they take longest).
- Add green beans at T‑12 min (oil, salt, pepper, garlic).
- Add salmon in the center for the final 8–12 min. Broil briefly for extra color.

## Notes / swaps
- Skin‑on crisps best; serve skin‑side up for crunch.
- Sweet‑savory glaze variant: 2 tbsp maple + 1 tbsp soy + 1 tsp Dijon + 1 tsp rice vinegar (brush at start and halfway).
- Finishers: basil oil drizzle, lemon zest, or a knob of herb butter.
