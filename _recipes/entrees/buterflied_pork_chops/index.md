## Overview
Quick cast‑iron pork chops, butterflied for fast, even cooking, finished with a silky pear–onion pan sauce. Served over fluffy rice to catch every drop.
- Serves: 2
- Gear: 12‑in cast iron, saucepan with lid, tongs, knife, instant‑read thermometer (optional)

## Ingredients (cook by feel)
### Pork + sauce
- 2 thick pork chops, butterflied (open like a book)
- Kosher salt & black pepper
- Neutral oil + butter
- 1 onion, thinly sliced
- 1–2 ripe pears, thinly sliced (peeled optional)
- Splash white wine, cider vinegar, or water
- Dijon mustard, 1 tsp (optional)
- Extra butter (small knob) to finish
- Lemon wedge (optional)

### Rice
- White rice, 1 cup (rinsed until water runs mostly clear)
- Water, 1 1/2 cups (or use light stock)
- Salt, pinch
- Optional: 1 tsp butter or olive oil

## Steps
1. Start the rice (15–20 min)
   - Combine rinsed rice, water, pinch of salt, and optional butter/oil in a saucepan. Bring to a boil, stir once, reduce to low, cover, and simmer 12–15 min until water is absorbed. Rest off heat, covered, 5–10 min; fluff with a fork.

2. Butterfly and season chops
   - Slice each chop horizontally almost through and open flat. Pat dry; season generously with salt and black pepper.

3. Sear chops
   - Heat cast iron over medium‑high until lightly smoking; add a thin film of oil.
   - Sear chops 2–3 min per side to deep golden. Lower heat to medium; cook to 135–140°F. Transfer to a warm plate; tent 5 minutes (carryover to ~145°F).

4. Pear–onion sauce
   - Pour off excess fat, keep ~1 tbsp. Add 1 tbsp butter, onions, and a pinch of salt; sauté 2–3 min.
   - Add sliced pear; cook 2–4 min until softened and lightly caramelized.
   - Deglaze with a splash of wine/vinegar/water; scrape fond. Stir in Dijon if using; simmer 30–60 sec to glossy. Swirl in a small knob of butter; season and add a squeeze of lemon.

5. Serve
   - Spoon rice into bowls/plates. Top with chops and plenty of pear–onion sauce.

## Notes / swaps
- Herb hit: thyme or rosemary works if you have it; add with the onions.
- Extra richness: butter‑baste chops before resting.
- Heat split: add minced jalapeño to your portion of sauce; keep Jessica’s mild.
