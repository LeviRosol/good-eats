Gear: 12‑in cast iron, sheet pan, instant‑read thermometer

## Overview
Thick-seared chops finished in a silky tomato–basil sauce (with cherry tomatoes) and served alongside crispy roasted/smashed potatoes. Sour cream provides the creaminess; no heavy cream needed.

## Ingredients (cook by feel)
### Pork
- 2 thick pork chops (1–1¼ in)
- Kosher salt & black pepper
- Neutral oil + butter (for searing/basting)
- Herbs: rosemary + oregano (thyme if you have it)
- 4–6 garlic cloves, lightly smashed

### Pan sauce
- 1 small shallot (or ¼ onion), minced
- 1–2 garlic cloves, minced
- Cherry tomatoes, halved (good handful)
- White wine (splash ~⅓ cup) or chicken stock (~½ cup)
- Marinara (~½–¾ cup)
- Sour cream (2–3 heaping tbsp; fold in off heat)
- Butter (small knob)
- Big handful basil, sliced
- Optional: 1–2 tsp balsamic or a squeeze of lemon; pinch red pepper flakes
- Parmesan, finely grated (to finish)

### Potatoes (side)
- Small white or Yukon potatoes, halved (or boil smalls whole to smash)
- Olive oil, kosher salt, black pepper
- Garlic powder or minced garlic; rosemary/thyme
- Optional: red pepper flakes on half (Jessica’s no‑spice half plain)

### Drizzle (optional)
- Garlic‑salt sour‑cream drizzle (sour cream + generous garlic salt + water to thin; chill 10–30 min)

## Steps
1. Preheat oven to 450°F with a sheet pan inside.

2. Potatoes  
   - For smashed: Boil small potatoes in salted water until nearly tender. Drain, steam‑dry 1–2 min. Oil hot sheet, place potatoes, smash with a sturdy cup. Oil, salt, pepper, garlic, herbs.  
   - Roast face‑down ~20 min; flip or broil last minutes for extra crunch (pull earlier if very small).

3. Sear chops  
   - Pat dry; season generously with salt/pepper.  
   - Cast iron on med‑high 3–4 min to light smoke; add thin film of oil.  
   - Sear 2–3 min/side to deep golden. Add 1–2 tbsp butter, smashed garlic, rosemary/oregano; baste 30–60 sec.  
   - Lower to medium; cook, flipping, to 135–140°F internal. Rest 5–8 min (carryover to 145°F).

4. Sauce base  
   - Pour off excess fat, leave ~1 tbsp.  
   - Sauté shallot + minced garlic 30–60 sec.  
   - Add cherry tomatoes + pinch salt; blister 2–3 min, mash a few for body.

5. Deglaze & build  
   - Add wine/stock; scrape fond; reduce by about half.  
   - Stir in marinara; simmer 1–2 min.  
   - Off heat, whisk in sour cream until silky; return on very low 20–30 sec if needed (don’t boil).  
   - Finish with a knob of butter and basil; balance with balsamic/lemon; season to taste.

6. Optional oven finish (nice touch)  
   - Nestle chops back into the sauce, shower Parm + basil, and pop the skillet into the 450°F oven 2–4 min to melt/bubble. Rest 2–3 min.

7. Serve  
   - Spoon sauce over chops. Plate with crispy potatoes and optional garlic‑salt cream drizzle.

## Timing cadence (once oven is hot)
- 00: Potatoes on  
- 12: Start chop sear  
- 17: Chops to 135–140°F → rest  
- 20: Build sauce  
- 23: Sour cream/butter/basil  
- 24–26: Optional oven finish  
- 30: Plate

## Notes / swaps
- Herbs: rosemary + oregano worked great when thyme was overgrown.  
- Brightness: a teaspoon of balsamic or a squeeze of lemon makes the sauce pop.  
- If sauce ever looks like it might split, whisk in a teaspoon of cold water and a small knob of butter.

## Pairing
- Red: Chianti Classico or Barbera.  
- White: Vermentino or Sauvignon Blanc.  
- Rosé: dry Provence.
