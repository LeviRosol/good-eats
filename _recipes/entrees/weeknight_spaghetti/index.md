## Overview
Jarred‑sauce spaghetti dialed up: hard‑browned beef, tomato‑paste fond and wine, simmered jar sauce, basil‑butter finish, and an optional pepper‑pesto swirl. Garlicky toasted panko adds crunch.
- Serves: 4
- Gear: 12‑in skillet or Dutch oven, pasta pot, wooden spoon

## Ingredients (cook by feel)
- Spaghetti (or other long pasta), 12–16 oz
- Ground beef, 1–1.25 lb (80/20 ideal)
- Olive oil
- Kosher salt & black pepper
- Onion, 1 small, minced (optional)
- Tomato paste, 1–2 tbsp
- Red wine, splash (~1/3 cup) or water/stock
- Jarred marinara, 24–32 oz
- Dried oregano or Italian seasoning, pinch
- Butter, 1–2 tbsp (for finish)
- Fresh basil, big handful, chopped/torn
- Pepper Pesto, 1–3 tbsp per bowl (optional, to taste)
- Parmesan, grated

### Crunch topping
- Panko, ~1/2 cup
- Olive oil or butter, 1–2 tbsp
- Garlic, 1 clove, minced (or a squeeze of roasted garlic)
- Pinch salt

## Steps
1. Boil pasta
   - Bring a big pot of salted water to a boil.

2. Brown hard
   - Film skillet with oil; heat to shimmering. Add beef in an even layer; season. Let it sizzle undisturbed to develop a deep brown crust, then break up. Push to edges; add onion if using; cook until softened.

3. Build sauce
   - Stir in tomato paste; cook 30–60 sec to toast. Deglaze with red wine; scrape fond and reduce by half. Add jarred sauce and a pinch of oregano; simmer gently.

4. Make the crunch
   - In a small skillet, toast panko in oil/butter with garlic and a pinch of salt until golden. Set aside.

5. Cook pasta and finish sauce
   - Cook pasta to al dente; reserve a mug of pasta water and drain. Off heat, stir butter and most of the basil into the sauce; season to taste.

6. Toss & serve
   - Return pasta to the pot with a ladle of sauce and a splash of pasta water; toss to coat glossy. Plate with extra sauce.
   - Optional pesto swirl: loosen a spoon of Pepper Pesto with a little pasta water; swirl into your bowl.
   - Top with Parmesan, remaining basil, and crunchy panko.

## Notes / swaps
- Richer: add a splash of cream or a knob of butter to the sauce.
- Veg add‑ins: mushrooms or diced peppers sauté with the beef.
- Heat: red pepper flakes on your bowl only for Jessica’s mild.
