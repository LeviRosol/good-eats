## Overview
Classic dark‑roux gumbo with andouille, chicken thighs, shrimp, and a gentle fold‑in of crab. No okra/filé—body comes from a deep roux plus a few mashed baby potatoes. Serve as-is or over a little rice.
- Serves: 6–8
- Gear: 6–8 qt Dutch oven, 12‑in skillet (optional), whisk/wooden spoon, instant‑read thermometer

## Ingredients (cook by feel)
### Proteins
- Andouille sausage, 12–16 oz, sliced
- Chicken thighs, 1.5–2 lb, bite‑size pieces
- Shrimp, 1 lb, frozen OK (thawed/patted dry), 26–31 ct
- Imitation crab, 8–12 oz, flaked (fold in at the end)
- Kosher salt & black pepper

### Trinity & aromatics
- Onion, 1 large, diced
- Celery, 3 ribs, diced
- Bell pepper, 1, diced
- Garlic, 4–6 cloves, minced
- Scallions & parsley, chopped (finish)

### Potatoes
- Baby potatoes, 1.5–2 lb, halved (reserve ~1 cup to mash for thickening)

### Dark roux
- Neutral oil (or half oil/half butter), ~1/2 cup
- All‑purpose flour, ~1/2 cup

### Liquid & seasoning
- Chicken stock, 6–8 cups (as needed for thickness)
- Bay leaves, 2
- Cajun/Creole seasoning, 1–2 tbsp (mild for Jessica)
- Paprika (sweet or smoked), 1 tsp
- Dried thyme and oregano, 1/2 tsp each
- Worcestershire, 1–2 tsp (optional)
- Cayenne or hot sauce to taste (on your bowl)

### Finish
- Lemon wedges or a splash of cider vinegar
- Cooked rice (optional, small scoops)

## Steps
1. Brown sausage and chicken
   - In Dutch oven over medium‑high, brown andouille; remove. Season chicken with salt/pepper; sear until lightly browned; remove. Leave flavorful fat in the pot.

2. Make a dark roux
   - Add oil to reach ~1/2 cup fat total. Whisk in ~1/2 cup flour. Cook, stirring constantly over medium to medium‑low, 20–30+ minutes until deep chocolate brown and nutty. Keep it moving; don’t burn.

3. Build the base
   - Stir in onion, celery, and bell pepper; cook 3–5 min until softened. Add garlic 30–60 sec.
   - Season with Cajun/Creole spice, paprika, thyme, oregano, bay leaves.
   - Slowly whisk in 6 cups warm stock until smooth.

4. Simmer with potatoes and meats
   - Add potatoes, sausage, and chicken. Simmer gently 20–30 min until potatoes are tender and chicken is cooked through.

5. Potato-thicken
   - Scoop out ~1 cup tender potatoes; mash smooth with a ladle and stir back in. Adjust thickness with more stock if needed—aim for a lush, spoon‑coating broth.

6. Finish seafood
   - Add shrimp; simmer 3–4 min just until pink/opaque (120–125°F). Kill the heat; fold in imitation crab to warm through 1–2 min. Remove bay leaves.

7. Brighten and serve
   - Taste; add salt/pepper. Brighten with lemon or a splash of vinegar and a dash of Worcestershire if using.
   - Ladle into bowls (optionally over small scoops of rice). Top with scallions/parsley. Add heat to your bowl only.

## Notes / swaps
- Stock depth: add a spoon of soy or fish sauce for umami if stock is light.
- Make‑ahead: great next day. Reheat gently; add a splash of stock if thick.
- Seafood timing: keep shrimp/crab out if holding long; add when reheating to avoid overcooking.
